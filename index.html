        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          Dave grew up in a small town called Chittenango, NY. As a burbs boy he
          didn't have shit to do so he had to make his own fun. Dude picked up a
          bike and rode it around with his friends. "Hell yea this shits sick!" he
          thought.Then one of his homies rode a bike off a curb. "Ohhhh hell nah"
          Dave said, and he busted a fat j-hop off a curb cut like a G. His dudes
          were impressed, and bought him a pound of maple bacon to congradulate him.

        <h2>Haro Bikes</h2>
        <p>
        Mirra quickly became the talk of the town. Old people would say
        "That boy is gonna hurt himself very badly, so badly he may even
        need to see a doctor or something." That is a direct quote. After
        a while of stealing everyones girls, Haro bikes took notice.
        They knew this guy had something special, and put him on the team
        at the ripe age of 13 in 1987. Dave now not only wanted to be the best in the town
        he wanted to be the best to ever do the damn thing.

        <h2>The Man, The Myth, The Mirra</h2>
        <p>Awwwwwwww shit it was on! Dave was going hard as hell learning all
        the stunts and creating new ones that made people freak tf out. He met
        Nyquist and they started to push eachother to levels BMX had never seen.
        Dave went pro in 1992, and was ready to show the world what he got.
         X-Games BMX had never seen such a powerhouse. He won a medal at every
         X-Games from 1995-2009 with the exception of 2006 cus he felt like givin some new guys a shot, but then he came back like fuck yall I'm still the greatest.

        <h2>Video Game</h2>
        <p>
          Lezbereal: one of Mirra's greatest accomplishments was scoring a
          fuckin video game. Everyone had that shit, which ended up exposing
          BMX to such a wide variety of antisocial teens. Honestly Dave is
          probably responsible for introducing BMX to more people than any other
           single human in history.

        <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
        <p>
          Dave was a real 21st century rennaisance man. He went on to race
          little cars through dirt jumps, ride road bikes at 200mph across
          oceans, and raise a wonderful family.

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately being an athlete on the level of Dave Mirra takes its
          tolls. He suffered many injuries and the one that did him in was
          repeated head trauma. CTE is no joke, protect your head people.
          Dave committed suicide for reasons unknown.
